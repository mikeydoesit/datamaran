# Datamaran Javascript Assessment

This is a simple script written to fulfil the brief outlined below.

## Brief

Convert score for each source in ranks based on their values. So highest score should be 1 and lowest
one should get the highest rank. final_score_rank column will be calculated by taking average of source
scores for each category and then calculating rank similar to how we did for the sources
Examples for rank calculations:
`10,30,20,40` -> `4,2,3,1`
`0,10,90,40` -> `4,3,1,2`
`10,20,20,50` -> `4,2,2,1` (Note here we have same rank 2 for the 2 scores but that means that next one
gets rank 4)
